This project implements an SRWDatabase that searches across a configurable list of other databases and returns the results as a single result set with the records in the order of the databases in the configurations file.  (I.e., records from the first database are returned first.)

This component, when added as a jar to the SRW server, supports SRW/SRU access to multiple other SRW/SRU databases.

Documentation for installation and operation of the SRW/SRU server can be found on the [SRW/SRU WikiHomePage](http://code.google.com/p/oclcsrw/wiki/WikiHomePage)
